# Blackjack
A free-to-play BlackJack style game made using JavaScipt. During developement I learned JavaScipt basics and worked with arrays, sorting algorithms, and random functions in order to sort and deal the cards. The game keeps track of your money and chips and is a fun way to play BlackJack without spending any money!

This was my first sizeable project, and it was super interesting to make!

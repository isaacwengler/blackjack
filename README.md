# blackjack
A free-to-play BlackJack style game made using JavaScipt. During developement of this solo-projects, I learned JavaScipt basics and worked with arrays, sorting algorithms, and random functions in order to sort and deal the cards. The game keeps track of your money and chips, and was tested for edge cases to eliminate bugs.
